6.1: Introducting Multiprocessing library
-------------------------
- can spawn new processes that will each have their own GIL
    - both concurrent and parallel
- need the __name__ == "__main__" or else there will be an exception thrown
    - prevent others who may import your code from accidentally launching multiple processes
- awkward because we have to use use start() and join()
