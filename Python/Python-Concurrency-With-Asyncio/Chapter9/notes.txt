9.1: Creating a REST API with aiohttp
----------------------
- REST: representational state transfer
    - key concept is a resource -> anything that can be represented by a noun
- aiohttp provides webserver functionality through the web module
- can then define routes with a RouteTableDef
    - has decorator that lets us specify the request
- aiohttp application class acts as a dictionary
- every request that our route gets will have a reference to the application instance through the app field
- signal handler oon application to handle setup tasks
- can parameterize routes and get the value through the reuqest.match_info dictionary
