7: Handling blocking work with threads
-----------------------
- can use multithreading with asyncio to run blocking apis

7.1: Introducing the threading module
-----------------------
- can create and manage threads via the threading module
    - exposes the Thread class, accepts function to run in a different thread
- I/O released GIL, so we can run IO in different threads concurrently
- exceptions are only thrown in the main thread
- can use daemon threads (long running background tasks)
- thread class has run method that we can override
