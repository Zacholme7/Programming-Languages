2.1: Introducing Coroutines
--------------------
- think of a regular python function, but can pause execution and wake up later
- async lets us define a coroutine
- await lets use pause our coroutine when we have long running operation
- coroutines are not executed when we call them directly
    - it creates a coroutine object that can be run later
    - need to explicitly run it on an event loop
- await keyword is usually followed by a call to a coroutine
    - specifically, an object known as an awaitable (this is not always a coroutine)
- using await will cause the coroutine following it to be run
    - in constrast, calling a coroutine directly will produce a coroutine object
- await expression will pause the coroutine where it is contained in until the coroutine we awaited finished and returns a result
