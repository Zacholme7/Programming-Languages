5: Non blocking database drivers
-------------------------
- typical SQL libraries block, so we need to use async ones

5.1: Introducing Asyncpg
-------------------------
- use asyncpg which will asynchronously connect to postgras databases and run queries against them

5.2: Connecting to a Postgres database
-------------------------
- example shows connecting to an example database

5.3: Defining a database schema
-------------------------
- can execute statements using asyncpg
- defines the statements that we want in this section

5.4: Executing queries with asyncpg
-------------------------
- write a program to execute all of these statements
- execute() is a coroutine so we have to await the call

5.5: Executing queries concurrently with connection pools
-------------------------
- true benefit of asyncio for I/O bound operations is the ability to run multiple tasks concurrently
    - queries have to be independent from each other
- executemany coroutine takes in one SQL statemetn and a list of tuples that we want to insert
