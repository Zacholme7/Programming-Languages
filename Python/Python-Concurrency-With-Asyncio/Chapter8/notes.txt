8: Streams
-----------------------
- many use cases opf sockets rely on a few conceptually simple operations
- using streams is the recommended way to build network based applications in asyncio

8.1: Introducing Streams
-----------------------
- streams are a high lvel set of classes/fucntions that create and manage network connections and generic stream of data
- built on top of apis known as transports and protocols
    - directly wrap sockets providing a clean interface

8.2: Transports and protocols
-----------------------
- transport is an abstraction for communcation with an arbitrary stream of data
    - various transports depending on what source we are using
    - ReadTransport, WriteTransport, and Transport
- protocol is just a python class here, not something like HTTP/FTP
    - connection_made: transport calls this method when the underlying socket has successfully connected
    - data_received: transport calls this method whenever it receives data
- once we write protocol, use create_connector to create a socket connection and wrap it in the appropriate transport
