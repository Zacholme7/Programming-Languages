# Programming Languages Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository is my personal space for learning and experimenting with different programming languages. Here, you'll find directories dedicated to each language I'm currently exploring: Rust, C++, and Python.

## Structure
The repository is organized into language-specific directories:

- `/rust` - Contains Rust projects and exercises.
- `/cpp` - Houses C++ experiments, practice problems, and mini-projects.
- `/python` - Dedicated to Python scripts, learning exercises, and small applications.

## Goals
The primary aim of this repository is to track my progress as I delve into different programming paradigms and enhance my coding skills across various languages.
