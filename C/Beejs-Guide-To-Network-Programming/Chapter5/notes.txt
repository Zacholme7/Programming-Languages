5.1: getaddrinfo() - prepare to launch
-------------------------
- helps set up structs for later on
int getaddrinfo(const char *node, const char *service, const struct addrinfo *hints, struct addrinfo **res);
    - node: the host name/ip address to connect to
    - service: the port or a service
    - hints: addrinfo with relavant info
- this is the more modern version in comparison to sockaddr_in, can handle ipv4 and ipv6

5.2: socket() - Get the file descriptor
-------------------------
- sidetip. use AF_INET in struct sockaddr_in and use PF_INET in you call to socket
    - af = address family
    - pf = protocol family
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
- allow you to say what kind of socket you want (ipv4/6, stream or datagram, tcp or udp)
- use call from getaddrinfo() to fill int he socket
s = socket(res->ai_family, res->ai_socktype, res->ai_protocol)
- returns a file descriptor for the socket
